# THRD Coding Challenge ‚Äì Pricing Engine

## üíº Overview

This project is a solution to the THRD coding challenge. It implements a simple **pricing engine** that analyzes product inventory and sales data to recommend new product prices based on real-time business logic.

## üßæ Business Rules

The script processes product and sales data and applies the following rules:

1. **Low Stock + High Demand** ‚Üí Increase price by **15%**
2. **Dead Stock** (no sales in last 30 days) ‚Üí Decrease price by **30%**
3. **Overstocked Items** (quantity > 100 units) ‚Üí Decrease price by **10%**
4. **Minimum Profit Rule** ‚Üí Ensure at least **20% profit** over cost price

Final prices are rounded to **2 decimal places** and suffixed with "INR".
